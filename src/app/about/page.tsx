        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I'm Jacob Farrington, a data scientist and developer focused on building tech in the world of soccer and analytics. My passion lies in creating tools that bridge the gap between performance and insight â€” from match dashboards for youth teams to player similarity engines and geospatial analysis.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I'm currently working on <strong>MatchMetrics</strong>, a platform that captures and delivers match insights to clubs, starting with manual data collection and evolving toward full automation using computer vision.

          Outside of work, I enjoy poker, the stock market, staying active, and a good comedy podcast. I bring creativity, speed, and clarity to every project I take on.
